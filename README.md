# English-Hinglish-Translation
The English to Hinglish Translation project aims to provide a seamless conversion of English text into Hinglish, a hybrid language that incorporates elements of both English and Hindi. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques and a powerful pre-trained model, this project offers a robust solution for bridging the language gap.
# Installation
To run the English to Hinglish Translation project, you'll need to install the following libraries and dependencies:

1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

   Install it using the following command:
   ```
   !pip install nltk
   ```

2. **Transformers Library**: This library from Hugging Face provides easy-to-use APIs for working with state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

   Install it with:
   ```
   !pip install transformers
   ```

3. **SentencePiece**: SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer that mainly focuses on Neural Network-based text generation systems where the vocabulary size is predetermined prior to the neural model training.

   Install it using:
   ```
   !pip install sentencepiece
   ```

4. **PyTorch**: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library.

   You can install it using the following command:
   ```
   !pip install torch
   ```

# How it Works
The pre-trained model ('facebook/nllb-200-3.3B') used for translation.
Natural language processing techniques employed for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word replacement.
